# Ryan Santos ePortfolio

This page will contain three projects worked on during my time in Southern New Hampshire University's Computer Science program. Each project will contain a narrative that describes enhancements that were made to them for my Computer Science Capstone course.

## Code Review

The following video is a code review of the projects used for the Capstone final project.

## Local Coffee Shop

The Local Coffee Shop mobile application can be found [here](https://github.com/santosryan/local-coffee-shop).

The artifact used was a mobile application that was created the previous term in CS 360 â€“ Mobile Architecture and Programming. The goal of the project was to create a mobile application for a fictional coffee shop. The application needed to incorporate a few major features and additional functionalities. The application needed to have an ordering system, a way to view submitted orders, a Find Us feature, an about us and contact page and a rating system. The project also required the use of a database as well as some sort of local storage. For the additional functionality, I decided to implement the usage of a photo gallery. 

I chose this artifact because I believed it was the project that showcased everything that I have learned throughout my time in the computer science program here at SNHU, in regards to software development. This project was an extremely challenging one, but also one of the most rewarding things I have ever worked on in my academic career. Being able to create a mobile application entirely from scratch with no previous experience and going through the entire process of planning and designing and development was an immense and valuable experience. I also selected this artifact because it was one that I was not able to fully complete during the duration of the course but wanted to make sure I had created a fully functional mobile application. My skills and abilities are showcased throughout this entire artifact, from using different data structures, to implementing databases, working slightly with security, and implementing features from other applications and websites. As stated previously, this was my first time developing a mobile application and being able to do so in 8 weeks shows my determination to succeed and strong work ethic. I was able to improve the artifact by completing the implementation of the cart and order tracking, cleaning up unneeded code, adding comments where I previously had none, and expanding on others to include more detailed information. I also removed imports and variables that were not used in the classes. With these enhancements I was able to meet the course objectives which included employing development techniques that are effective in addressing data storage, implementing functionality that achieves application design goals, and developing functional code that is guided by best practices. 
	
While enhancing and modifying the artifact I did learn quite a bit. Through the code review I was able to see many flaws and mistakes in my work that I previously had made and was not able to see. I also found out that one of my weak points in software development is not leaving detailed comments, and it is something I need to improve on. I also learned that I should clean up unneeded code and variables as well as remove test routines that are no longer needed. Throughout my modification I found many instances of old code that I had used to test out functionality of certain things that I did not remove. The main challenge I faced was time management. I was unable to complete the enhancements that I made, when I originally created the artifact last term, and making sure I completed them in two weeks was a bit of a challenge.
