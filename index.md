# Ryan Santos' ePortfolio

This page will contain three projects worked on during my time in Southern New Hampshire University's Computer Science program. Each project will contain a narrative that describes enhancements that were made to them for my Computer Science Capstone course.

## Code Review

The following video is a code review of the projects used for the Capstone final project.

## Local Coffee Shop

The Local Coffee Shop mobile application can be found [here](https://github.com/santosryan/local-coffee-shop).

The artifact used was a mobile application that was created the previous term in CS 360 – Mobile Architecture and Programming. The goal of the project was to create a mobile application for a fictional coffee shop. The application needed to incorporate a few major features and additional functionalities. The application needed to have an ordering system, a way to view submitted orders, a Find Us feature, an about us and contact page and a rating system. The project also required the use of a database as well as some sort of local storage. For the additional functionality, I decided to implement the usage of a photo gallery.<br /><br /> 

I chose this artifact because I believed it was the project that showcased everything that I have learned throughout my time in the computer science program here at SNHU, in regards to software development. This project was an extremely challenging one, but also one of the most rewarding things I have ever worked on in my academic career. Being able to create a mobile application entirely from scratch with no previous experience and going through the entire process of planning and designing and development was an immense and valuable experience. I also selected this artifact because it was one that I was not able to fully complete during the duration of the course but wanted to make sure I had created a fully functional mobile application. My skills and abilities are showcased throughout this entire artifact, from using different data structures, to implementing databases, working slightly with security, and implementing features from other applications and websites. As stated previously, this was my first time developing a mobile application and being able to do so in 8 weeks shows my determination to succeed and strong work ethic. I was able to improve the artifact by completing the implementation of the cart and order tracking, cleaning up unneeded code, adding comments where I previously had none, and expanding on others to include more detailed information. I also removed imports and variables that were not used in the classes. With these enhancements I was able to meet the course objectives which included employing development techniques that are effective in addressing data storage, implementing functionality that achieves application design goals, and developing functional code that is guided by best practices. <br /><br />
	
While enhancing and modifying the artifact I did learn quite a bit. Through the code review I was able to see many flaws and mistakes in my work that I previously had made and was not able to see. I also found out that one of my weak points in software development is not leaving detailed comments, and it is something I need to improve on. I also learned that I should clean up unneeded code and variables as well as remove test routines that are no longer needed. Throughout my modification I found many instances of old code that I had used to test out functionality of certain things that I did not remove. The main challenge I faced was time management. I was unable to complete the enhancements that I made, when I originally created the artifact last term, and making sure I completed them in two weeks was a bit of a challenge. <br />

## Authenticated

The Authenticated application can be found [here](https://github.com/santosryan/authenticated).

<div style="width: 600px; height: 300px; overflow-y: scroll; border: 1px solid #000000">
The artifact used was the Authentication System that was created in IT 145 – Foundation in Application. The goal of the project was to create a basic login authentication system for a zoo system. The program worked by prompting the user to enter in their login information for the system, then system then read from a text file to validate the user’s information using their username, password and hash password. <br /><br />
	
I chose this artifact because I believed that I would be able to showcase my ability to create and use data structures and algorithms. The artifact included creating functions that would use a text file to validate information. A database could be used to create a csv file of user information, and then that file could be used to authenticate users when they provide the appropriate credentials. To simulate this real-world application, I made the text file into a csv file, created a class that would hold the user information, and created an ArrayList of that object that would then allow me to create an authentication system. By adding these new features, I believe I made the application and code itself a bit more reusable. I do believe I hit my mark on meeting the course objectives on my ability to create, manipulate, and use data structures in conjunction with algorithms. <br /><br />

While enhancing and modifying the artifact I did learn a little bit. I noticed again that my code was not well commented or commented at all in some places, however I did go back and added comments where there were none as well as added comments to all the new enhancements on the code. While working on these enhancements I became a lot more familiar with ArrayLists and file handlers as this time I created my own rather than being handed pieces of one. Getting the csv file handler to function correctly was the biggest hurdle as I needed the information to be read correctly in order to correctly authenticate the user. I did run into a few issues with formatting of the csv file and reading the information, but I was able to get all of those issues resolved. <br /><br />

## SQL Scripts

The SQL Scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/santosryan/intro-sql-scripts).

<div style="width: 600px; height: 300px; overflow-y: scroll; border: 1px solid #000000">
The artifact used were SQL scripts that were created in DAD 220 – Introduction to SQL. The goal of the project was to create scripts to complete various tasks that performed create, read, update and delete operations on databases and tables. <br /><br />
	
I chose this artifact because I believed that I would be able to showcase my ability to create, design, and manage databases. The artifact included different SQL statements that covered everything from basics on creating databases and tables, to advanced queries to extract specific data, so it showed that I have a solid understanding of creating, organizing and managing a database. To improve the artifact, I created a new script that would accomplish most of the same things but with the use of imported data from a csv file and also once all the changes are made, output the changes to an updated csv file. I do believe I hit my mark on meeting the course objectives on my ability to create databases, manipulate data in tables, and extract specific information. <br /><br />

While enhancing and modifying the artifact I did learn a little bit. I noticed that my scripts were not organized very well with comments coming after the statements and with some statements not being formatted correctly for readability. I did change the organization of comments for each statement and also corrected the formatting of the statements to increase the readability of the scripts. I also learned how to use files in a database environment as this was something I had not previously done. I did run into some issues while trying to implement the importing data into the databases and tables and also querying to export data to a file, but I eventually resolved the issues and completed the enhancements.  <br /><br />
